## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps

**Required for functionality plugin**
- [CounterStrikeSharp](https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp) 
- [MultiAddonManager](https://github.com/Source2ZE/MultiAddonManager)
- [cs2kz](https://github.com/KZGlobalTeam/cs2kz-metamod)
- [Radiopanel Tutorial](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=russian&id=187002729)

**How to install?**
1. **Customizing the Radiopanel:**
   - Before installation, adjust the radiopanel (configuration file) according to your needs. This file will determine how the radio will function on your server. It‚Äôs important to tailor it to meet the specific requirements of your server.
2. **Creating a Workshop Addon:**
   - Create a new workshop addon that will include the necessary files, including `resource/ui/radiopanel.txt`. This file is crucial as it contains the settings for your radiopanel.
   - You can also include other files necessary for your server in this addon. This way, you can avoid creating a large number of addons, which could slow down the connection process (connect) as it loads each addon individually.
3. **Uploading the File to the Server:**
   - Upload the `resource/ui/radiopanel.txt` file to your server. This step ensures that all players will have access to the customized radiopanel when they connect to the server.
4. **Installing MultiAddonManager:**
   - Install the **MultiAddonManager** plugin on your server. This plugin will allow you to easily manage and update multiple addons at once, simplifying server management and ensuring that all necessary files are always up to date.
5. **Releasing the Workshop Addon:**
   - After officially releasing your workshop addon, you can start using the new menu that you customized in the radiopanel. Make sure that all players have the addon installed to ensure a consistent gaming experience.
